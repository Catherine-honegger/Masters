\section{Proposed Task Completion Time-Line}
The research is expected to be completed by April 2018. Regular meetings are held with the supervisor once a week. There is an open door policy enabling casual meetings to be arranged  ensuring that there is constant feedback throughout the lifespan of the proposed research. 

Table \ref{tab:timeline} presents a set of major tasks along with their preliminary completion dates for the proposed work.
