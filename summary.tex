Currently no storage or mapping techniques allow for the extendibility of multidimensional sparse arrays. This research proposes to improve the modelling and representation of extendible multidimensional sparse arrays. The proposed solution incorporates compression and storage efficiency techniques by using BESS to divide the sparse array into chunks. Storing the elements within these chunks in a linear matrix using row major order. As well as using PATRICIA Trie indexing to index the BESS chunks. The proposed solution shows how the new XSAS techniques are applied in data warehousing.
